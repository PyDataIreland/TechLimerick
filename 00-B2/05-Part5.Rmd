***CS2B â€“ Risk Modelling and Survival Analysis ***


* The emphasis is placed on being able to apply statistical methods to actuarial problems using real data sets and the open-source software environment R. 

* Time Series. Probability Distributions, Survival Analysis, Stochastic Processes

Markov Chain
========================

A particle is moving on the graph below by starting on a randomly chosen vertex (each with
the same probability) and at each time step moving along one of the adjacent edges to a
neighbouring vertex, choosing the edge with equal probability and independently of all
previous movements.

Dgree Sequence
=================

  .pull-left[ ![](images/B2-Q5-Graph.JPG)]

.pull-left[  |Vertex  | Degree |
 |------- |--------- |
 |A | 2 |
 |B | 4 |
 |C | 4 |

Part 1
======================

Create a matrix with the transition matrix with probabilities using the state names as
{A,B,C,D,E,F,G} and plot the transition matrix graph. 
```{r}
 #Create a matrix with the transition probabilities.

Matrix2<- matrix(c(
  0,1/2,1/2,0,0,0,0,
  1/4,0,1/4,0,1/4,0,1/4,
  1/4,1/4,0,1/4,0,1/4,0,
  0,0,1/2,0,1/2,0,0,
  0,1/3,0,1/3,0,1/3,0,
  0,0,1/3,0,1/3,0,1/3,
  0,1/2,0,0,0,1/2,0),
byrow=TRUE,nrow=7)
```

---

```{r}
Matrix2

```



---

***Check Row Totals***


```{r}
sum(Matrix2[1,])
sum(Matrix2[2,])
sum(Matrix2[3,])
```


```{r}
rowSums(Matrix2)
```

---

Part 1
===================




```{r}
#Create a vector with state names
statesmatrix1 <- c("A","B","C","D","E","F","G")
statesmatrix1
```





```{r}
transitionmat1 <- new("markovchain",
    states=statesmatrix1,
    transitionMatrix=Matrix2)
```



```{r}
statesmatrix1

```

---


```{r}
markovchain::plot(transitionmat1)


```

---


```{r}
transitionmat1

```



---

Part 2
===================
What is the absorbing state in the transition matrix? Find the steady state or stationary
distribution.





```{r}

# What are the absorbing states?

markovchain::absorbingStates(transitionmat1)
```

```{r}
# Find the steady state or stationary distribution.
markovchain::steadyStates(transitionmat1)
```



---

Exercise 3
========================

How much time it will take to reach the steady state if the particle is starting from state
A, B and C?

---

<h5> Matrix Multiplication </h5>



```{r}
class(Matrix2)

dim(Matrix2)

```

---

```{r}

# Time to reach steady state if particle starts from A

starting <- c(1,0,0,0,0,0,0)

starting <- matrix(starting,byrow=TRUE, nrow=1)

starting


```

---



<h4> Check for compatbile dimensions</h4>

```{r}
dim(starting)

dim(Matrix2)

```

<h4>Matrix Multiplication</h4>

```{r}
starting %*% Matrix2

```

---

```{r}

A <- starting
B <- starting
C <- starting %*% Matrix2
  
all(A==B)

all(A==C)

all(A==C)==FALSE
  
```

---


```{r}
n=0

while(  all(starting%*%Matrix2 == starting)==FALSE  ){
  starting=starting%*%Matrix2
  print(starting)
  n=n+1
  print(n)
}    
```

[1] 54
[,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7]
[1,] 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.15 0.15 0.1
[1] 55
There were 50 or more warnings (use warnings() to see the first 50)

---

Time to reach steady state if particle starts from B

```{r}
m=0

while(  all(starting%*%Matrix2 == starting)==FALSE  ){
  starting=starting%*%Matrix2
  #print(starting)
  m=m+1
  #print(m)
} 

m
```

---

Time to reach steady state if particle starts from C


```{r}
p=0
starting=c(0,0,1,0,0,0,0)

while(starting%*%Matrix2!=starting){
    starting=starting%*%Matrix2
    #print(starting)
    p=p+1
    #print(p)
}
p
```
