\noindent A general insurance company has sold 5000 Accident Benefit Policies to independent lives.\\\\
\medskip
\noindent The number of claims follows a Poisson distribution with parameter 500. The amount of claim
from individual policy is following a Gamma distribution with parameters $\alpha = 250$ and $\lambda = 0.5$.\\
\medskip

\noindent Calculate the aggregate claim amount paid by the insurer by simulating 5000 values if the
insurer retains only 350 (assume the aggregate claim amount follows a compound Poisson
distribution). 
%%Use seed corresponding to your birth year.
