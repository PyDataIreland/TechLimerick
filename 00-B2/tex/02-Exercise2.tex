Q. 2) ABC General Insurance Company Limited has sold total of 1000 insurance policies under 3
type of insurance, where each type of insurance gives rise to a maximum of one claim per year.
The insurer hold the following portfolio:

All policies and claims are independent.

ii)
Simulate a set of 5,000 observations from the insurerâ€™s aggregate claims size
distribution. Use seed corresponding to your birth year.
Summarize the output, draw plot histogram of the simulated results, and comment on
the results.

[Note the numbers will change with change in seed]
The claims seem to be highly skewed with Q1 equal to 29.03, Q2 equal to 260.88 and Q3 equal to
393.86. The highest value is 2664.99.

The distribution seems to follow exponential distribution, which is consistent with underlying
distribution of claims.
