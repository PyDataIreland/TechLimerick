An actuary is investigating the asymptotic behaviour of the sample autocorrelation
function for two time series models.
(i) Generate, using a random number generator seed of 967, a simulated sequence
of n = 200 observations for a first-order moving average process with
parameter β 1 = 0.4, assigning the simulated values to a vector called YMA. 
(ii) Generate, using a random number generator seed of 967, a simulated sequence
of n = 200 observations for a first-order autoregressive model with parameter
α 1 = 0.45, assigning the simulated values to a vector called YAR.

(iii) Plot, on four separate graphs, the sample autocorrelation function (sample
ACF) and sample partial autocorrelation function (sample PACF) for each of
the two time series models, YMA and YAR, generated in parts (i) and (ii). 
(iv) Comment on the general features of the plots in part (iii) with reference to
whether they are consistent with the theoretical behaviour of the
corresponding functions for the true models.

The `acf()` function in R can also provide a vector output of the sample ACF values,
with component i giving the sample ACF at lag i – 1, provided that the plot argument
of the function is set to ‘FALSE’.
(v) Determine the numerical values for the sample ACF at lag 2, for each of the
two time series models, YMA and YAR, generated in parts (i) and (ii).

(vi) Construct R code that
 first sets a random number generator seed of 967; and then
 generates 1,000 random vectors (of length n = 200) for each of the two
models in parts (i) and (ii); and
 assigns the values of the sample ACF at lag 2 for each random vector to
two vectors ACF2MA and ACF2AR (each of length 1,000).

(iv)
For a MA(1) model we would expect...
...the PACF to decrease exponentially to 0...

... and the ACF to have clear spikes up to lag 1 with insignificant spikes for all lags >
1.

For an AR(1) model we would expect...
... the ACF to decrease exponentially to 0

... and the PACF to have one clear spike at lag 1 with insignificant spikes for all lags
> 1.

These features are broadly in line with the graphs above.

There appear to be non-zero values at lag 22/23 in the graphs which may need to be
investigated...

... however, this may not be an issue as we would expect some random spikes as the
sample ACFs won’t conform perfectly with the theoretical behaviour.

(vii)

Determine the mean and variance of the two vectors, ACF2MA and ACF2AR,
generated in part (vi).

(viii) Plot, on two separate graphs, the histograms of the two vectors, ACF2MA and
ACF2AR, generated in part (vi).

(ix)
Comment on the results in parts (vii) and (viii), including whether they agree
with the expected asymptotic behaviour.

Part (iii) was very well-answered but some candidates lost marks for not including
appropriate titles in the graphs. The minimum requirements for an appropriate title
were that it must include the appropriate series name and also indicate whether the
function plotted was a sample ACF or a sample PACF. The default axes labels were
deemed appropriate in this case. Additionally, some candidates lost marks for not
including either the R code or the graphs in their answer scripts.
Part (iv) was reasonably well-answered but some candidates either mixed up the
expected behaviour of MA(1) and AR(1) processes or mixed up the expected behaviour
of the ACF and PACF within each process.
Answers to part (v) were mixed with a number of candidates losing marks because they
included the output of the ACF for a number of lags without making any attempt to pick
out lag 2. Some candidates also lost marks because they picked out the value of the
wrong lag. Additionally, some candidates lost marks for not including the R output
and/or not separately stating the lag 2 values in their answer scripts.
Answers to part (vi) were also mixed with many candidates getting stuck here and not
proceeding with later parts of the question.


Part (vii) was surprisingly poorly answered. This was mainly due to many candidates
getting stuck in part (vi). Candidates are reminded that, in such circumstances, the best
approach is to provide a “dummy” answer and carry on with the remaining parts of the
question to receive carry forward credit. Additionally, some candidates lost marks for
not including the R output and/or not separately stating the calculated values in their
answer scripts.
Part (viii) was again poorly answered. Many candidates lost marks for not
appropriately labelling the graphs. The minimum requirements for appropriate
labelling were that either the x-axis and/or the title needed to clearly indicate which
vector is being plotted and also needed to reference lag 2. The default y-axis labels
were deemed appropriate in this case. Additionally, some candidates lost marks for not
including either the R code or the graphs in their answer scripts.
Candidates are reminded to take careful note of all instructions that are provided with
the exam in order to maximise their performance in future CS2B exams.
Part (ix) was extremely poorly answered. Very few candidates demonstrated an
understanding of the expected asymptotic behaviour of these processes. Note that the
formula in the Core Reading for the asymptotic variance of ACF2MA, denoted by
equation (1), is incorrect. The correct formula for the asymptotic variance is given by
equation (2).
