Accessibility
=================

We want to raise the bar about how to make R conferences more accessible for people with disabilities.

### 1. Hearing Impairment

For hearing impairment, the plan is straightford: hire a stenographer to do "Speech to Text Translation" (STT).
An unnamed company actually sponsored this for PyCon Ireland in 2019. The feedback on it was very very good.

STT provides extra benefit for making the conference more accessible for people who dont not speak english as a first language.
Python Ireland will provide relevant contact details if and when necessary.

### 2. Visual Impairment

For Visual Impairment - This is a body of knowledge that still needs to be developed.
A Forwards Team Member, who has close contact with this matter, has been invited to be the Chair of Accessibility.  
We are collecting up the ideas here: https://github.com/forwards/event_best_practices
