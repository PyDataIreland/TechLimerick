Data is provided for ‘BMIClaims’ of 150 policyholders and corresponding claim count.
(BMIClaims.csv)
i) Obtain 95% confidence interval for the standard deviation of BMI (using qchisq). (6)
ii) Further test the standard deviation of BMI to be equal to 4 by obtaining p value. State
your conclusion of the test. (6)

Q. 4)
If obese is defined to be BMI above 30, use binom.test to calculate 99% confidence
interval for proportion of obese people and comment on the likelihood if more than
20 pc are obese.
Claim frequency can be calculated as claim count divided by number of policyholders.
Test whether claim frequency is different between obese and others.

> BMI <- read.csv("BMIClaims.csv")
> n <- length(BMI$BMI)
> alpha <- 0.05
...
[2]
> sqrt(c((n-1)*var(BMI$BMI)/qchisq(1-alpha/2,df=n-1),(n-1)*var(BMI$BMI)/qchisq(alpha/2
,df=n-1)))

> sigma <- 4
> statistic <- (n-1)*var(BMI$BMI)/sigma^2
> statistic

> qchisq(alpha/2,n-1,lower=FALSE)

Since p-value is less than 5%, there is sufficient evidence to reject the hypothesis,
i.e. the standard deviation of BMI is not equal to 4.

Exact binomial test
data: x and n
number of successes = 10, number of trials = 150, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5
99 percent confidence interval:
0.02522882 0.13728337
sample estimates:
probability of success
0.06666667

Since 99% CI for p doesn’t contain p=0.2
it is unlikely that the proportion of obese policyholders is more than 20%.. ..

Comparison of Poisson rates
data: y time base: m
count1 = 3, expected count1 = 0.66667, p-value = 0.02493
alternative hypothesis: true rate ratio is not equal to 1
95 percent confidence interval:
1.001171 26.282304
sample estimates:
rate ratio

Since p-value is less than 5% i.e. 2.5%, there is sufficient evidence to reject the hy
pothesis, i.e. Claim frequency is different between obese and others.
(Alternatively, can use prop.test)
