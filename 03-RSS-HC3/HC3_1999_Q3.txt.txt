3. The infant mortality rate per 1000 live births and the percentage adult female literacy rate for a sample of countries are given in the table below.

    \item Sum 1000 1231 
    \item Sum of squares 88268 103411 
    \item Sum of products 77068 
\end{itemize}

 
(i) Make a scatter plot of these data using the vertical axis for infant mortality rate. (4) 
 
(ii) Use the additional information contained in the table to fit a linear relation which could be used to predict infant mortality rate from adult female literacy rate. (4)

\item Country C is out of step with the others, and is very influential in determining the fitted
line. In fact neither line fits the lower literacy rate values at all well, although line B does
rather better than A for the upper values.The variability in y as x decreases suggests
that a linear regression assuming constant variance is not lively to do well; a weighted
regression might be considered if suitable data is variable.
