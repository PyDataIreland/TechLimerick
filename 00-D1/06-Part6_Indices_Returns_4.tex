vi) Comment on the appropriateness of the model fitted. (2)


Your actuarial friend has suggested that the current model can be improved by removing the
variables which do not impact the direction of Sensex returns at 95% confidence level and
refitting the GLM with ‘logit’ link function.

vi)
Interpretation

 As the residual deviance came down significantly from Null Deviance of
223.21 to 32.90, the variables are able to classify the direction appropriately


\begin{itemize}
    \item One huge outlier (Jun-09) can impact the accuracy of the result (Removing this may reduce the residual deviance further)
    \item  The independent variables are not independent and they are interdependent (Correlations are very high among the sectors). 
Hence the standard errors may not be appropriate

    \item As this data is a time series data serial correlation between the observations need to be considered and the model may have to be fitted after removing serial correlation.

\end{itemize}






```


```R

vii) Update the model fitted in (ii) above, as suggested by your friend and display the summary
of the model.


viii) Compare the models in (ii) and (vii) using an appropriate test and comment on the
difference in the residual deviances between the two models.

Interpretation








p-value of the comparison is 0.94 > 0.05 thus not rejecting the null hypothesis of no significant difference between the two models. 

So the model did not improve significantly based on the friend's suggestion
