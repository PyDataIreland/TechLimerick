VISAS

- People being refused Visas, and denied access to France, were a huge problem at UseR! 2019.

  Try to get the Polish Statistical Agency involved in the bid. I think this would help with Visa Applications. 

  The rationale here is that when an traveller has to apply for a visa, it makes the process much easier if the invite is signed by a government agency.

- State that Poland has an extensive network of foreign missions where foreign travellors can make visa applications

- Make sure to point out that Poland is in the Schengen Area.

- Make sure to point out that Poland is less expensive than Western European cities, and that cost would not be prohibitive to 
  R community members from countries like Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova etc.

CODE OF CONDUCT

- Address the code of conduct matters early. Display the code of conduct prominently on your website. Sponsors will check this first before continuing.

- Devise a Code of Conduct reponse plan. 
  Involve organizations such as Forwards and the R Consortium Working Group on Diversity and Inclusion (RCWGDI) in its development and deployment.

SPONSORSHIP DRIVE

- Utilize the WhyR international program to promote UseR! 2021, and attract sponsorship.
  You can mention that you are developing such an event for Dublin, which is the EMEA HQ for several large corporations.

- Pending approval of the ERUM permanent committee, the ERUM LinkedIn page will be rebranded for UseR! 2021 in June 2020 (when ERUM 2020 is over).
  This page would be used to develop sponsor relations on an ongoing basis.
  Appoint a social media chair early in 2020.

- State the aims of what you would do with an enhanced budget.
    * Speech to Text Translation.
    * High Quality livestreaming.
    * Enhance the Travel Scholarship budget.
    * Carbon offsetting.


Diversity and Inclusion

- The conference committee should seek to provide responsible roles in the organization for people from marginalized backgrounds, and who are career young, and 
  provide mentoring to help them achieve success.

- Examples of such roles would be Session Chairing, Social Media management, Developing action plans for Codes of Conduct, Sustainability and Accessibility.
  
- This provides an oppurtunity for people from marginalized backgrounds to grow into future leaders of the R community.

- Assistance would be sought from R Ladies, Forwards and RCWGDI. 


ACCESSIBILITY

- Make sure the venue is wheel-chair accessible.

- Just as important: Make sure the Social Event is wheel-chair accessible. There must be accessibility plans for these also.

- Make sure your website is screen-reader friendly and accessible to those with visual impairment.

- Be ready to develop an action plan for getting people to hotels and back.


LGBTQ Community

- Co-ordinate with Rainbow R / RLGBTQ to provide them rooms and venues for informal mixers and networking events. 

- Dedicated rooms for Coffees and Lunchs.

- The plan would consider that anonymity and non-disclosure of personal details to be paramount. Rainbow R would be responsible for organizing and promoting these events.

- Gender Neutral Bathrooms would be provided throughout the venue.


SEATING

- Make sure there is enough seating in the lobbies.




RAIL

- Promote access to Warsaw by Rail (for example, OBB Night Jet Service) with a Social Media Promotion (#Train2UseR)

- Try and describe rail access to a few large East european Cities; Riga, Kiev.
