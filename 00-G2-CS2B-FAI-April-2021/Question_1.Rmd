1 Before answering this question, the R package for Markov chains should be loaded 
into R using the following code: 
install.packages("markovchain") 
library(markovchain)
Xt is a Markov chain on the state space {1,2,3} with the following transition matrix: 
൭
p 1 – p 0
q 0 1 – q
0 r 1 – r
൱
where 0 < p, q, r < 1. 
(i) Construct an R function, with arguments p, q and r, that generates a Markov 
chain object for Xt. [5] 
 Assume that p = 0.75 and r = 0.25. 
(ii) Construct R code that calculates the stationary distribution of Xt for values of 
q from 0.1 to 0.9 inclusive, at intervals of 0.1, pasting your results into your 
answer script. [7] 
(iii) Plot a graph showing the stationary distributions of Xt calculated in part (ii) as 
a function of q. You should include three separately coloured lines on your 
graph, each line representing the stationary probabilities of each state. [8]
