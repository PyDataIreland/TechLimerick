2 Before answering this question, construct the function, rpareto, in R using the 
following code: 
rpareto = function(n, alpha, lambda){ 
rp = lambda * ((1 - runif(n))^(-1/alpha) - 1) 
rp}
The rpareto function generates a random sample of size n from a two-parameter 
Pareto distribution with parameters α and λ. 
(i) Generate, using rpareto, a random sample of size 25,000 from the 
two-parameter Pareto distribution with parameters α = 3 and λ = 1, assigning 
the simulated values to a vector called A_vec. You should set a random 
number generator seed of 123 before generating A_vec and use the R function, 
head(), to display the first eight values of A_vec in your answer script. [3] 
(ii) Construct an R function, called A_exceed_u, with two arguments, A and u, that 
returns only the non-zero entries of a vector, E, where vector E is of length 
25,000, with entries defined as: 
Ei = maxሼAi – u, 0ሽ.
Use the R function, head(), to display in your answer script the first eight 
values of A_exceed_u when A = A_vec and u = 1. [8] 
(iii) Construct another R function, called F_u, with one argument, 
A_greater_than_u, that returns a vector of length 101, containing the 
probabilities: 
PሺAi – u ≤ x | Ai > u), where x ≥ 0, 
for values of x from 0 to 10 inclusive, at intervals of 0.1. 
Use the R function, head(), to display in your answer script the first eight 
values of F_u when A_greater_than_u = A_exceed_u with arguments 
A = A_vec and u = 1. [9] 
(iv) Plot, on a single graph, four line graphs of the values of F_u against x for 
the values of x specified in part (iii) when A_greater_than_u = A_exceed_u, 
A = A_vec and u = 1, 2, 3 and 4. You should use separate colours to identify 
each line graph and you should clearly specify which value of u is represented 
by each of the four line graphs. [10] 
(v) Comment on the graph produced in part (iv). [6]
