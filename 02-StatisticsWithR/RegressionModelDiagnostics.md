#### Diagnosing a Linear Regression
The ease of implementation fosters the impression that linear regression is easy: just use the \texttt{\textbf{lm()}} function. Yet fitting
this is only the beginning.

After a linear regression analysis has been performed. It is good practice to verify the modelâ€™s quality
by running diagnostic checks.

The approach we will take is to create diagnostic plots, by plotting the model object. Rather than producing a scatterplot, this method will produce several diagnostic plots:

```


```R

attach(iris)
Fit1 <- lm(Sepal.length ~ Sepal.Width)
plot(Fit1)


```


```R


Next, identify possible outliers either by looking at the diagnostic plot of the residuals

Another approach is to use the \texttt{\textbf{outlierTest()}} function of the \textit{\textbf{car}} package:

```


```R

#If package not installed, uncomment next line.
#install.packages("car")

library(car)
outlierTest(Fit1)


```


```R
\begin{verbatim}
> outlierTest(Fit1)

No Studentized residuals with Bonferonni p < 0.05
Largest |rstudent|:
    rstudent unadjusted p-value Bonferonni p
132  2.79155          0.0059429      0.89143

\end{verbatim}
```


```R
####Influence Measures
Finally, identify any overly influential observations by using the \texttt{\textbf{influence.measures()}} 
function.
If an observation is considered influential, it will be indicated with an asterisk on the right hand side. Interpretation of the individual statistics, such as \textit{DFFITS} and \textit{DFBETA} are beyond the scope of this course.

```


```R



\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
influence.measures(Fit1)
\end{verbatim} 
\end{framed}

\end{document}
```
