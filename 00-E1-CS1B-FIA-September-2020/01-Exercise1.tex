1 An employee at a caf√© has been trained to set the coffee machine so that an espresso
coffee portion results in 2.0 grams of coffee being placed into a cup. Knowing that
variations are expected, the employee pours eight portions and measures the amounts
to be 1.95, 1.80, 2.10, 1.82, 1.75, 2.01, 1.83 and 1.90.
(i) Calculate an 80% confidence interval for the mean size of espresso coffee
portions. [4]
(ii) Comment on whether the mean portion of coffee is equal to 2.0 grams. [2]
[Total 6]
