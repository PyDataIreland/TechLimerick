An employee at a caf√© has been trained to set the coffee machine so that an espresso
coffee portion results in 2.0 grams of coffee being placed into a cup. Knowing that
variations are expected, the employee pours eight portions and measures the amounts
to be 1.95, 1.80, 2.10, 1.82, 1.75, 2.01, 1.83 and 1.90.
The data can be entered into R using the following code:

```{r}
amounts=c(1.95,1.80,2.10,1.82,1.75,2.01,1.83,1.90)
```

(i) Calculate an 80% confidence interval for the mean size of espresso coffee
portions.

Part 1
==============================================
amounts = c(1.95, 1.80, 2.10, 1.82, 1.75, 2.01, 1.83, 1.90)
(i) Use t.test():

---

Part 1
==============================================
t.test(amounts,conf.level=0.80)
From output:
80 percent confidence interval: (1.836, 1.954)


---
Part 2
==============================================
(ii) Comment on whether the mean portion of coffee is equal to 2.0 grams.


Part 2
==============================================
(ii) The employee sees that value 2.0 is not in the interval and therefore a hypothesis of a 2
gram portion would be rejected at the 20% level.


---

Part (i) was well answered. In part (ii) most candidates correctly rejected the hypothesis,
but many failed to state the level of the test.
