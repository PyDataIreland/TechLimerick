2 A researcher has collected the following data on a group of students, regarding
whether they passed or failed an exam and whether or not they attended tutorials:
Number of students Exam passed Exam failed
Attended tutorials 132 27
Did not attend tutorials 120 51
(i) State the hypotheses of this test. [2]
[Total 11]
The data can be entered into R using the following code:
amounts=c(1.95,1.80,2.10,1.82,1.75,2.01,1.83,1.90)
The data can be entered into R in matrix form using the following code:
The reasercher wants to establish whether tutorial attendance is independent of exam
success, using a chi-square test.
(ii) Calculate the expected frequencies for the data under the null hypotheses
in part (i). [3]
(iii) Perform the test stating clearly your conclusion. [6]
exam.success = matrix(c(132,120,27,51),ncol=2,nrow=2)
